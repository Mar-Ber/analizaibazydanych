The original data file is the weather.txt file in the OriginalData folder.
It contains daily weather data from the Global Historical Climatology Network for one weather station (MX17004) in Mexico. 
The first column contains data (id, year, month, variable name), the remaining columns contain the values of the variables for the given day of the month (day, d1 - d31). 
Months with less than 31 days have structural missing values for the last day (days) of the month. Values are expressed with one decimal place.
The data was taken from the following page:
https://github.com/KAIR-ISZ/public_lectures/blob/master/Analiza%20i%20Bazy%20Danych%202021/Lab%202/Datasets/weather.txt

To get a copy of the original data file, copy the data from the above page to a clean file with the .txt extension.


On its basis was created an importable data file named weather_importable.xlsx. 
It is available in the folder OriginalData and has been copied to folder AnalysisData. 
It contains unchanged data from the weather.txt file, divided into the following rows and columns.
